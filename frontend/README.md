## Frontend structure

The frontend is configured in the following way:

- The components are located in the [components](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/gr1927/gr1927/tree/master/frontend/src/components) directory.
- The custom hooks are located in the [hooks](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/gr1927/gr1927/tree/master/frontend/src/hooks) directory.
- The utilities, in eg. calculations are located in the [utils](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/gr1927/gr1927/tree/master/frontend/src/utils) directory.

**NB!**  
The frontend is dependant on the backend, so make sure that it's running.
